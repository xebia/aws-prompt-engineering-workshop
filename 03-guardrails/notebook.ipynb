They enable detection and mitigation of harmful, biased, or inappropriate content by setting rules, categories, and thresholds. You can apply guardrails by defining policies in the Bedrock console or API, then associating them with your AI models or agents. This ensures generated responses are automatically screened and adjusted before reaching users, improving safety and compliance in AI applications."

        "Amazon Bedrock guardrails are configurable safety mechanisms designed to control and filter the outputs of generative AI models, ensuring that responses adhere to organizational policies, ethical standards, and regulatory requirements. Guardrails work by applying a set of rules and content filters that detect and mitigate harmful, biased, or inappropriate content, such as hate speech, violence, explicit material, or personally identifiable information (PII).\n",
        "\n",
        "When a prompt is sent to a Bedrock model with an associated guardrail, the model\u2019s output is automatically screened against the defined guardrail policies before being returned to the user. If the output violates any configured rules\u2014such as containing restricted topics, unsafe instructions, or sensitive data\u2014the guardrail can block, redact, or modify the response according to the specified action (e.g., BLOCK, REDACT, or ALLOW with warning).\n",
        "\n",
        "Guardrails are managed through the Bedrock console, API, or infrastructure-as-code tools like CloudFormation. You can define custom policies, select content categories to filter, and set thresholds for detection. Guardrails can be versioned, allowing for safe updates and rollbacks. By integrating guardrails, organizations can reduce the risk of AI misuse, improve compliance, and build safer, more trustworthy AI applications."
